An implementation of unidirectional weighted graph in Java.

##methods

`graph` represents the graph that the algorithm is used on

`init()`- function to initialize the given graph.

`copy()`- function to do deep copy of our graph.

`isConnected()` - a boolean method that checks if our graph is a Linking graph .

`shortestPathDist()`- that function stands for helping us to get the weight of the shortest path.(with Dijkstra's algorithm)

`shortestPath()`- a function that helps us to get our path (n0...n1.....n).

`save` is a method to save our graph into a text file.

`load` is a method to read the text file that we saved with the save method,and creating a new graph with the data in the text file.
